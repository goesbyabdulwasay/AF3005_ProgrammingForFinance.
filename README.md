Smart Financial Management System â€“ AF3005 Assignment 1
FAST-NUCES | BS Financial Technology | Spring 2025
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This assignment is all about building a Smart Financial Management System for SecureBank using Python & ipywidgets. The system automates key financial tasks, making it interactive, dynamic, and user-friendly. We tackled five different financial operations, each designed to simulate real-world banking and investment scenarios.

ðŸ“Š What We Built
âœ… Loan Eligibility & Interest Rate Calculation â€“ Determines if a customer qualifies for a loan based on employment status, income, and credit score. Uses interactive inputs and provides real-time approval/rejection feedback.

âœ… Investment Risk Assessment â€“ Analyzes a portfolio of stock returns and categorizes it as High, Medium, or Low Risk. Skips invalid data and ensures proper classification with efficient looping.

âœ… Loan Repayment Tracker â€“ Simulates monthly loan payments, deducting a fixed amount each month until the balance hits zero. Displays the remaining loan balance after each payment.

âœ… Stock Price Monitoring & Trading Strategy â€“ Tracks daily stock prices, ignores missing values, and triggers a sell alert when the price hits PKR 200. Implements loop control with continue and break statements.

âœ… Currency Exchange Rate Tracker â€“ Simulates daily fluctuations in the PKR/USD exchange rate, increasing by 1 PKR per day until the target rate is reached. Simple, effective, and interactive.

ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters?
This assignment combines finance and programming, showcasing how automation can streamline banking and investment decisions. Each module is designed to be interactive, efficient, and practical, just like real-world financial applications.
